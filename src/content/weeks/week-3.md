1. Watch [Urgent Publishing After the Artist’s Book](https://www.youtube.com/live/7LaSsDZPkN8?si=ossnWd3VijohYZBt&t=11560) between 3:12:40 and 3:58:38. You can also read [the article here](https://apria.artez.nl/urgent-publishing-after-the-artists-book) or the [original slides](https://soulellis.com/writing/feb2021/).
2. Write at least a one-page reflection after watching the video. Consider the following prompts to guide your reflection:
   1. When the author says “publishing has always been political,” what does that mean?
   2. What makes publishing “urgent”?
   3. The author argues we should look “after the artist’s book” and focus on platforms and acts (spreadsheets, toolkits, memes, protest signs, livestreams). What do you think what else besides traditional books should “count” as publishing in 2026 and what shouldn’t? Why?
