title: "Algorithm & Memory"
description: "This week we're diving into algorithmic processes and memory in p5.js!"
longDescription: |

  This week we will explore how to create algorithmic processes in p5.js, as well as how to use memory to store and work with OOP to create more complex and dynamic sketches.

Now that you have your initial system capturing participation, the next step is to build on top of what you’ve already created by introducing memory and persistence. Consider how your system can remember interactions over time and use that information to shape future responses.
<br/><br/>

- Extend your current inputs—sound, motion, gesture, light, text, or network data—by recording them in a way that persists beyond a single session. Explore options like local storage to retain participant actions.
- Use the stored data to create feedback that evolves. How does the system respond differently when it “remembers” prior interactions? How might repeated engagement over minutes, hours, or days change the experience?
- Think about how your system can encourage participants to return. Could past activity trigger new cues or invitations?

  This is the continuing process of our [project 3: Community Protocol](https://tech-a.designfuture.space/#module-3:-cybernetics-of-live-input). We will continue to refine and develop this project over the next few weeks. The full description is [here](https://tech-a.designfuture.space/#module-3:-cybernetics-of-live-input).
