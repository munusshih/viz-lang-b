title: "Rules & Conditionals"
description: "How can we use utility conditionals to make decisions in our code and create more complex behaviors?"
longDescription: |
  This week we'll explore how to use conditionals to create rules that help our code make decisions.

  <br/><br/>
  By using `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements, we can set up conditions that change how our sketches behave based on different inputs or states. This will allow us to create more dynamic and interactive designs.

This week, you will add rules and conditionals to your design system so that it can make decisions on its own. Instead of endless variation, begin defining limits: clear boundaries for how far your system can shift in material, color, scale, or proportion.
<br/><br/>

- Use at least two conditionals (if, else if, else) to guide when and how changes happen.

- Let the system do the heavy lifting: rules should both enable variation and enforce constraint, keeping results within a recognizable family.

- Start considering how these limits might translate into material choices and fabrication methods.
  <br/>
  This step will set up Week 4, when you begin preparing your system for physical production.
