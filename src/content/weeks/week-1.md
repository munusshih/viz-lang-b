imageMeta: "The code for the chairs is inspired by the book [Form + Code](https://formandcode.com/) by Casey Reas, Chandler McWilliams, and LUST. In this implementation, the chairs are arranged in a circular formation and connected to a database using [p5.party](https://p5party.org/), allowing the number of chairs displayed on the homepage to dynamically reflect the number of people currently viewing the page."

## Assignment

**Due:** Feb 3, 2026

1. Prepare a physical notebook you like as your self-reflection journal for this course. Throughout the semester, you are expected to keep a notebook or one centralized place to house all of the reflection writing, creative processing, in-class activities, and external reading and research notes. You will use your notebook as source material for your group projects as well as your final reflection at the end of the semester. It can be any size or style, as long as you feel comfortable using it regularly. Bring it to class.
2. Read [Access Intimacy: The Missing Link](https://leavingevidence.wordpress.com/2011/05/05/access-intimacy-the-missing-link/) by Mia Mingus.
3. Write at least a one-page reflection after reading the essay. Consider the following prompts to guide your reflection:
   1. Have you had experiences with access intimacy?
   2. How does it shape the way you think about community?
   3. How can we foster access intimacy within our peer groups and the larger class community?
4. Finish this [Welcome Survey](https://forms.gle/C4GG7j9y6x5Jnwws6) to help me get to know you better.
