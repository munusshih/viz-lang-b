Without the noise of words, in nature there is no need for much speech, and we can feel each other’s existence, as well as the beauty of blending with nature.\nFor me, I especially enjoy being alone in quiet places surrounded by plants. It brings deep relaxation to both my body and mind, and helps me release the exhaustion of daily life.",

    "projectDescription": "Cosmic Trust is about believing in the universe..not in a blind, passive way, but as an active, guiding energy that intersects with our efforts. I began my journey as a strict atheist, rooted entirely in science and logic. I still deeply respect science, yet over time, a part of me has shifted toward the spiritual. I’ve realized there exists a subtle energy in the universe, a force that shapes and influences life in ways we may not fully understand. It’s not about expecting miracles without effort; manifestation works, but only when paired with consistent action and intention. Challenges don’t disappear, they are the universe’s way of shaping us, building resilience, and nudging us toward our goals.\nThe universe is both beautiful and powerful. Celestial events, like eclipses, illustrate this dynamic energy. The patterns these movements form in the sky are symbolic of life itself: moments of darkness give way to light, and temporary interruptions can lead to new perspectives. Observing these patterns reminds us that life is a rhythm of challenges and revelations, and the unseen forces guiding us are as natural and inevitable as the movement of the planets.\nIn Cosmic Trust, these celestial patterns are translated into visual forms. The orbit of the moon around the sun, the shadows of eclipses, and the subtle waves of energy patterns all symbolize the universe’s influence on our personal journey. The shapes, rotations, and flows in my project are minimalistic but intentional, representing the invisible energy at work in our lives. They serve as a reminder that even small actions, when aligned with intention and trust, contribute to larger outcomes.\nThis project is an exploration of the harmony between action and faith, reason and wonder. By observing cosmic patterns, we recognize that life is interconnected, and growth often comes from surrendering to forces greater than ourselves while still working toward our goals. The visual patterns (ellipses, orbits, and rotations) reflect not only the science of celestial mechanics but also the spiritual idea that energy flows through all things, guiding, shaping, and supporting our journey.\nThe Cosmic Trust project, implemented through p5.js, visualizes this philosophy. Using code, I simulate celestial patterns and movements, such as eclipses, orbital rotations, and abstract energy flows. Users can interact with these elements, witnessing how forces intersect, influence, and create outcomes. The result is a meditative, immersive experience that encourages reflection on one’s personal journey, resilience, and the unseen energies at play.",

    "weeklyResponse": "I always found coding a little scary, but now that I’ve started, I’m actually loving it and can’t wait to try more and learn more. One of the first things I understood is how functions work. For example, the setup() function runs once at the very beginning  it’s where we set up the canvas, styles, and any initial values. After that, the draw() function keeps running in a loop, unless we stop it using noLoop().\nI’m also learning new functions step by step and experimenting with them, which has been really exciting. One thing I struggled with was uploading an image. I realized that it needs to be placed in the “assets” folder, but for some reason, I couldn’t get it to work. That’s something I still want to figure out.\nAnother question I had while exploring loops and patterns was about saving images. If I want to save a specific frame (and not every single one in the loop), I learned that I can use functions like saveCanvas() or saveFrames(), but apply them conditionally,  for example, only when a certain frame number is reached.",
    "teacherFeedback": "This is out of this week's scope, but you should be able ot use [if-else (see week 3)](https://tech-a.munusshih.com/week-3/) to save a specific frame. Like `if(frameCount===3)` per say.",

The story of Cheng Dieyi and Duan Xiaolou blends opera, love, betrayal, and survival.\nThe phrase “人，得自個兒，成全自個兒” (“One can only rely on oneself to be complete”) is deeply relevant. Dieyi devotes his life to Xiaolou, but in the end, he cannot depend on love, loyalty, or society for fulfillment. The tragedy shows that only by facing oneself—identity, pain, and truth—can one find dignity, even in despair.",

It is not completely the same but it's okay because it would've changed with the moving variables. First when I was working on this project I changed the shape of the circle to a square. And then I restricted the square to go to top left to bottom right. Having a fixed points. I did the same thing with another smaller square. Each of the squares you can change the size and the color. One last thing that I added was a constraint. There is a circle 'constraint' in the bigger square. Even when the square is the smallest it can be. Leading me to my randomization idea. In the constraint, the circle, every time the code is run/ restarted the size will be randomized 5-10. I wanted it to run once so I out in within set up instead of draw which loops. ",

    "projectDescription": "The concept of manifestation has always fascinated me—the idea that our thoughts, intentions, and focus can influence reality. Manifestation is more than wishful thinking; it is a conscious process of directing energy toward specific outcomes, visualizing them clearly, and aligning one’s actions with those visions. This project is inspired by that principle, aiming to create a visual experience that embodies the power of intention and focus. The central phrase, “COSMIC TRUST,” represents faith in both the universe and oneself, serving as a reminder that alignment with one’s inner goals is a gradual but achievable process. The subsequent appearance of the words “THOUGHT” and the customizable text below encourages reflection, transforming the canvas into a space where abstract ideas such as belief, creativity, and visualization become tangible.\nMy vision for this project was to design an interactive, animated piece that combines digital media and engagement to encourage viewers to reflect on the power of their thoughts. I wanted the letters of “COSMIC TRUST” to start scattered across the canvas, symbolizing the chaos and randomness of unaligned thoughts, and gradually converge into a precise, harmonious formation to represent clarity and focus. The delayed emergence of the word “THOUGHT” mirrors the moment when a focused intention crystallizes into awareness, while the user-customizable text allows participants to insert their personal vision or mantra. This ensures that each interaction with the piece becomes unique and meaningful. The inclusion of a video background adds depth and movement, providing a cosmic and immersive atmosphere that resonates with the theme of trust and universal alignment.\nThe code structure was designed to bring this vision to life. Each letter is treated as an object with properties such as position, size, and target coordinates. Initially, the letters are randomly scattered, with varied sizes to convey disorder. The lerp() function is used to interpolate positions and sizes smoothly over time, creating an animation where letters gradually align into the intended formation. The progress variable controls this transition, while a timer ensures that the secondary text appears only after the main animation completes. By integrating a GUI powered by dat.GUI, I enabled real-time customization: users can adjust text color, reset the animation, control progress manually, input personalized text, and save the canvas as an image. This combination of animation and interactivity transforms the viewer from a passive observer into an active participant in the creation process.\nUltimately, this project serves as a visual metaphor for manifestation: scattered ideas and intentions, once focused and nurtured, align into coherent outcomes. The interplay of motion, interactivity, and cosmic visuals encourages viewers to pause, reflect, and connect with their inner thoughts. By translating abstract concepts like trust, intention, and personal vision into a digital, interactive experience, the project demonstrates the power of visualization while showcasing how coding and creative design can intersect to produce meaningful, immersive artwork.",

    "weeklyResponse": "Previously, I had questions about how to add an image to the canvas and was initially a bit confused. After learning how to include images, I thought, why not try a video? I explored how to integrate a video background and experimented with a small animation as well. This allowed me to work with variables, transitions, and timing, making the project more dynamic and interactive. I enjoyed experimenting with different effects and seeing how motion and visuals could enhance the concept I wanted to convey.\nDuring the process, I also explored using dat.GUI to create a user interface for controlling parameters like text color, progress, and custom text. While I learned how to manage normal text within the canvas boundaries, I realized I still have questions about ensuring that GUI-controlled text stays within the canvas limits, especially when breaking it into multiple lines or adjusting dynamically based on user input. This has motivated me to explore further techniques for responsive text placement and alignment.",

Each particle has a home position corresponding to the text shape and can move freely in response to mouse interaction.\n\nWhen the user moves the mouse near the particles, they are repelled, creating a dynamic “dispersing and returning” effect. Particles gradually return to their original positions, producing a fluid and interactive visualization of the text.\n\nThe project uses a custom font loaded via a URL and demonstrates the combination of typography, particle systems, and interactive graphics in p5.js.",

    "projectDescription": "For this weeks assignment, I re converted to my original theme. And added a different aspect GUI and randomization. In addition to my GUI and randomization-- I added my constable. My constable (if-else) code goes along the lines of if my canvas size is 200x600 the color palette changes to monotone,, else it will be the default colors I have in code. My GUI is regarding the different weight of stroke. My minimum is 2 and my maximum is 5. Then my two other GUI's are regarding the X and Y axis of my canvas size. My randomization is regarding the canvas size curated once when it runs. My min is 200 and my max is 600. ",
    "credit": "I used chatGPT to help me with my code ideas and how to execute them. Especially for the monotone palette for my if-else constants. Also I used chatGPT to help me change my design to respond to canvas size being changed. So it automatically makes sure the design looks the same on each different looking canvas size. ",

Instead of the computer just reading the code with displaying shapes or text. Constant code adds a dimension to process what the output is going to be. We've been seeing what goes into the code(input), comes out of the code displayed(input). But with the added true/false variables,, we don't get the same design on how we entered it coding. Because the output is depending on to be equal to, less than or equal, more than or equal to be deemed the IF and everything else is categorized in ELSE. ",

    "weeklyResponse": "Through this project, I learned that the interaction distance greatly affects particle movement and the overall visual impression. By adjusting the force based on the distance between the mouse and particles, nearby particles scatter strongly while distant ones return slowly to their original positions, creating a natural motion. If the interaction distance is too short, particles barely move, limiting visual dynamics; if too long, the entire system scatters excessively, creating a chaotic effect. Therefore, setting an appropriate distance range is key to maintaining both particle freedom and visual stability.",

    "projectDescription": "For this project, I wanted to create a dynamic and visually engaging composition that incorporated several techniques and ideas I had learned in the last class. The main focus was on combining textures, shapes, typography, and interactivity to produce a piece that is both aesthetic and conceptually tied to my theme.The canvas starts with a gradient background that transitions from grey to black, giving a subtle depth and cosmic feel to the composition. Over this, I added a base circular shape, filled with a light grey color, which serves as an anchor for the other elements. On top of this, I applied a texture image using the dodge blend mode, which highlights the lighter parts of the image while maintaining the overall color harmony. This combination of gradient, base shape, and texture creates a layered effect that gives the canvas more visual interest and dimensionality.A key element in this work is the letters forming \"COSMIC TRUST,\" which I split and randomly positioned across the canvas with semi-transparent fills, allowing overlaps that create subtle interactions and a balanced chaos. One random letter receives a shear transformation each run, adding uniqueness and emphasizing cosmic randomness. I incorporated a dat.GUI interface to toggle between random and aligned letters and added buttons to save the canvas as PNG or SVG. This project let me combine gradients, textures, text manipulation, and vector graphics. Experimenting with shear and interactivity made the piece visually dynamic and conceptually aligned, reflecting what I’ve learned in class.\n",

Warm, broken arcs trace an orbit that never completes—echoes of external standards, deadlines, and roles. Inside, a full circle assembles from discrete particles; its integrity isn’t given, it’s accumulated. The contrast frames the quote, “One can only rely on oneself to be complete.” The rainbow gradient marks the many states we pass through—joy, doubt, growth—before coherence emerges. The work claims that completeness is not the world closing around us but the self aligning within.",

The main content includes making each playback a different canvas size, changing the middle image into different shapes and sizes, and making the background randomly switch among several light colors, as well as adding the color range of the border and text in random colors. In this way, it solves the problem that after having various random contents it still looks like the same picture. After these modifications, it can generate at least 20 different appearances, and it also increases the interactivity of this project.",

    "projectDescription": "For this project, I wanted to create a dynamic and visually engaging composition that brought together techniques and ideas I learned in class, while also exploring my theme of cosmic alignment and trust. Using p5.js, I combined gradients, textures, typography, randomness, and interactivity to build a piece that feels both aesthetic and conceptually rich.\nThe canvas begins with a gradient background that shifts from grey to black, creating depth and giving a cosmic tone to the composition. At its center is a light grey circular base, acting as a stable anchor. On top of this, I layered a texture image using the dodge blend mode, which highlights lighter regions while maintaining harmony with the background. This combination of gradient, circle, and texture creates a layered, dimensional quality that draws the viewer in.\nTypography plays a central role through the phrase “COSMIC TRUST.” I split the phrase into individual letters and positioned them randomly across the canvas. Their semi-transparent fills allow overlaps to interact, producing subtle layers and moments of balance within the chaos. To enhance this randomness, the letter sizes now scale dynamically with the canvas dimensions: on taller canvases, the height determines their proportions, while on wider canvases, the width sets their size. This ensures proportionality across all formats and ties the typography to the changing environment of the canvas itself. Additionally, one random letter is transformed with a shear effect on every run. This slight distortion emphasizes uniqueness and unpredictability, symbolizing how the universe often introduces irregular yet meaningful variations.\nA significant addition is the interplay of two circles. While the light grey base circle remains fixed at the center, a semi-transparent black circle is randomly generated and repositioned each time. When it overlaps the white circle, crescent-like shapes emerge, resembling phases of the moon. This cyclical effect introduces a sense of cosmic rhythm, reinforcing the theme of alignment, change, and trust in unseen patterns. The stroked ellipse also adapts in size relative to the canvas, stretching or shrinking to match proportions, acting as another shifting but balanced element in the composition.\nInteractivity is provided through a dat.GUI interface, allowing toggling between random and ordered text placement and enabling the artwork to be saved as PNG or SVG. This makes the piece versatile and experimental, with each run producing new alignments and visual outcomes.\nOverall, this project explores the balance of order and randomness, cycles and change. Through layered textures, dynamically scaling letters, lunar overlaps, and proportional ellipses, it reflects how the universe aligns in both predictable and surprising ways.",

Letting go of control and allowing randomness to decide placement, size, and shapes was new for me—and surprisingly fun. Each run of the code created a completely unique outcome, almost like the artwork had its own life. The overlapping letters, the shifting circles, made me realize that randomness can be just as beautiful as carefully planned design. It gave my artwork unpredictability and uniqueness every time.",

    "projectDescription": "Sound of Time is an interactive visualization that explores the evolution of classical music through data. It presents composers from the 17th to the early 20th century, expressing each through color, size, and motion.\n\nColors correspond to different musical eras such as Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Modern. The size of each circle reflects the number of compositions, while its movement represents the passage of time. As the timeline flows from 1700 to 1920, composers gradually emerge on the screen. When hovering over a circle, the composer’s name, era, and year appear, and clicking plays a tone that reflects the musical mood of that period.\n\nSet against a deep black background, each composer glows like a star, and the subtle pulsation of the circles symbolizes the living rhythm of music. Through the combination of visual data and sound, Sound of Time transforms musical history into an immersive experience — a poetic journey through time and tone.",

    "weeklyResponse": "This week, I explored how data can be felt, not just seen, through the process of turning classical music data into an interactive visual experience. It was both a technical and creative challenge, finding balance between data accuracy and emotional expression.\n\nBy connecting Python-based data preprocessing with p5.js visualization, I learned how musical information such as era, frequency, and composition count could be transformed into movement, color, and sound. Through debugging and iterative testing, I realized that each visual parameter—position, size, hue, and motion—carries its own meaning.\n\nThe biggest insight was that emotional data visualization is more about interpretation than coding. I’m still curious about how to make 3D interactions smoother in p5.js and how to design visuals that respond more intuitively to user behavior.",

    "projectDescription": "This interactive data visualization maps all the places I have visited in New York City, capturing details such as date, time, location name, mood, and whether I would recommend the place. Each visit is represented as a circle, with its horizontal position (x-axis) spread evenly across the canvas, and the vertical position (y-axis) mapped to the time of day, from early morning at the top to late night at the bottom. The color and size of each circle corresponds to my mood during the visit, giving visual weight to meaningful experiences. Clicking on a circle reveals a dynamic info panel with all details for that visit. The circles also feature subtle flickering, controllable via the dat.GUI interface, creating an effect reminiscent of city lights shimmering at night. Overall, the visualization combines temporal, spatial, and emotional dimensions to create a lively, personal map of my NYC experiences.",

    "weeklyResponse": "While working on this visualization, I realized the importance of choosing data that I could truly understand and relate to. Initially, I considered using an existing dataset, but it felt distant and abstract. By creating a dataset based on my own experiences—places I visited in NYC, the moods I felt, and my recommendations—I was able to engage more deeply with the data. At first, the project was challenging: mapping the x and y axes, deciding circle sizes, colors, and interactions, and ensuring everything displayed cohesively felt overwhelming. However, as the circles took shape and the interactive panels began to work, the visualization came alive, and it was incredibly exciting to see my personal experiences represented visually. I also learned the value of subtle interactions, like flickering circles, to make the visualization dynamic. Overall, this project taught me how to translate personal data into an engaging, meaningful visual story.",

    "weeklyResponse": "This week, I focused on enhancing my data visualization by adding interactive features, mood filters, timeline controls, and atmospheric elements like a gradient and a subtle NYC skyline. I’m still thinking of ideas for the physical presentation I want to experiment with lights, possibly using LEDs, but I’m unsure how to implement them since I don’t have much experience with electronics. I’m also considering using beads or threads to represent the data physically, which could create a tactile, visually engaging version of the visualization. It’s an exciting challenge to translate digital interactivity into a physical form.",

I also reconsidered the color scheme and data explanations, ultimately updating the layout and using Reso Printing and yellow paper for a simple and elegant visual.\n\nRegarding the data explanations, I considered how to use my legends to visually tell a story. I decided to include silhouettes of the animals and their basic information, even though the individual animal details are a bit lengthy. For animal enthusiasts genuinely interested in learning more about animals, I felt it was essential. My thinking is that the choice to read is up to the audience, but for designers who want to convey this message, providing it is a bare minimum.\n\nFor presentation, I initially considered using 3D printing to create physical objects. However, I really liked the point made in class last week that behind every data point lies a living entity. Therefore, I felt I wanted to express animals more vibrantly. I want to emphasize that data presentation doesn't always have to be so \"technological,\" so I thought of using hand-carved stamps. The stamp also provides opportunities for audiences to participate and guess the animals.",

In my data, the 20th animal was \"unknown birds,\" a line I could easily delete. Many of the animal names after that were also inconsistent. This highlights not only potential problems with the data collection system itself but also the challenges of data visualization methods and scope, and even how our understanding of the data itself is affected. \n\nBecause data visualization is a process of simplification and transformation, the selection and omission of data during this transformation are human choices. The most challenging aspect is how to transform lines of numbers into interpretable, meaningful, objective information while simultaneously presenting a subjective filter through the data.",

While this was interesting, I realized that my dataset lacked a central focus and a cohesive narrative. I decided to pivot and explore a concept that is both culturally rich and visually compelling: the number of languages spoken in India. This shift allowed me to create a dataset with a clear focus, emphasizing diversity, scale, and identity.\nThe Indian Languages Dataset I compiled includes 36 major languages, representing a small fraction of the 121 recognized major languages and over 19,500 dialects and speech forms found across India. Each language carries its own historical roots, regional presence, and set of dialects, revealing a living map of cultural and linguistic evolution. By sorting the languages from the most spoken to the least, the dataset highlights the varying scale of influence and reach of each language, while also drawing attention to the rich complexity of smaller, less-spoken tongues.\nThis dataset not only quantifies linguistic diversity but also provides a conceptual framework for visualization. It becomes a way to represent how millions of voices coexist, connect, and evolve over geography and time, celebrating India’s unique identity as a land of many languages and cultures. I Will represent my data using a mandala!\n",

    "projectDescription": "For my data sculpture project, I worked with a dataset on Indian languages, focusing on 36 major languages arranged from the most spoken to the least. After cleaning, filtering, and organizing the data, I identified clear patterns: some languages have millions of speakers and dozens of dialects, while others are smaller yet culturally significant. This process helped me clarify my narrative revealing India’s linguistic richness and the relationships between language, region, and identity.\nTo translate this dataset into both a digital and physical form, I conceptualized my system through a mandala, a structure that naturally communicates hierarchy, balance, and interconnectedness. The inputs in my system were ordinal (speaker count), nominal (color and pattern), and discrete (a finite set of languages). The outputs became visual attributes: orientation, size, shape, color hue, and repetition.\nEach of the 36 languages was assigned a unique shape, and the number of dialects within that language determined how many times that shape was repeated around the mandala. Some shapes appeared only a few times, while others repeated many times—creating a rhythmic pattern directly tied to the dataset. To bring this to life physically, I laser-cut the shapes out of wood, layering and arranging them radially to form a full mandala. The physical material adds warmth and permanence, while the repetition of shapes captures the scale and diversity embedded in the data.\nThe legends are incorporated directly into the piece using etched symbols and color cues, rather than separate printed sheets. This keeps the sculpture self-contained and intuitive, allowing viewers to interpret meaning through embedded visual rules.\nOverall, this project transformed linguistic data into an expressive structure—showing how 36 languages and their dialects unite into one coherent, culturally rich mandala that mirrors India’s vast, interconnected linguistic landscape.",

    "projectDescription": "My project engages the community of design students within the studio environment an active space where color, material, texture, and pattern constantly circulate. Using a live camera feed, the installation captures the surrounding visual field and extracts six dominant colors, generating a color palette that reflects whatever is currently present in front of the camera. With a simple gesture stepping into frame and pressing a key participants can transform everyday objects, clothing, books, fabric samples, or artworks into a real-time digital palette. The installation turns the studio itself into a living source of visual material.\nAs the project evolves, it will not only extract color, but also reinterpret it. Once a palette is captured, the system will generate an abstract composition derived from the six selected colors. These compositions may take the form of geometric structures, shifting patterns, or layered textures, visually expressing the chromatic identity of what was detected. Eventually, the system will attempt to capture and translate patterns from the video feed as well, connecting color and texture into a unified abstract visual outcome. In this way, reality becomes palette, and palette becomes artwork.\nParticipants are invited to engage repeatedly, experimenting with objects and materials to influence the emotional and visual tone of the generated results. Over hours and days, these interactions accumulate into a shared archive of palettes and abstract visuals a collective reflection of the studio’s shifting atmosphere. Beyond aesthetic exploration, the system provides a practical tool by allowing students to extract colors, study hex values, and document palettes for use in future design work.",

    "weeklyResponse": "Through developing this project, I learned how dynamic and unpredictable the environment becomes once it becomes the input itself. I discovered how an interactive system can both respond to a space and also shape how people behave within it. Experimenting with real-time color extraction taught me how sensitive cameras are to lighting, proximity, and movement, and how these variables constantly shift the palette. I also began examining the difference between capturing colors versus capturing actual surface qualities, leading me to question what information can be abstracted without being altered. While colors can be distilled into simplified palettes, textures behave differently they contain direction, depth, and complexity that resist reduction. This led me to understand that abstracting texture is not just a technical challenge, but a conceptual one: it raises questions about accuracy versus interpretation, compression versus essence. I am now considering whether textures should be preserved exactly as they appear or translated into symbolic representations. This reflection helped me understand that abstraction is not only about removing information, but about deciding what information matters, and how transformation can become its own kind of truth.",

    "weeklyResponse": "Through the design of this little game, I started by exploring how to create the effect of fire using particles. I used class to store objects and then put one object into another class (particles—fire—fire jet). Each layer had its own executive purpose. I discovered that deciding which function to place and execute requires a lot of experience and trial and error. For example, there are many details to consider in order to create small fires that spread. The fire extinguisher also uses a (particles-foam-foam spray) structure, but they have totally different executive purpose and function. \n\nAdditionally, there's keyboard movement function, such as a simple operation involving many intricate design details (release, hold, simultaneous presses, etc.).\n\nThis project felt like a summary and review of the course throughout the semester. From variables, loops, maps, custom functions, floor, arrays, push, mousePressed, keyPressed, vectorCreate, and velocity, I used them all in this project. I used AI to assist me with some complicated parts, but by reading each piece that it helps generate, I'm proud that I can understand over 90% of the code and adjust the values to achieve the desired effect. The process made me get more familiar with computational languages. \n\nRealizing that even a seemingly simple interactive game is full of design details. This project gave me a deeper understanding of the world created by programming languages, and also deepened my admiration and respect for them.",

Pressing N switches between day and night mode. Pressing B generates bubbles. Pressing W launches glowing food. Pressing P toggles party mode.",

    "weeklyResponse": "Through this project, I gained a deep understanding of the Unity WebGL build structure, the limitations of the browser environment, and the entire process of implementing Mediapipe-based motion recognition logic directly on the web. In particular, the most challenging part was resolving seemingly minor details—such as the file structure required by WebGL, differences between local and deployment environments, camera permission issues, CDN script version conflicts, and path errors introduced during compression—that could completely break the application.\n\nHowever, by pushing through countless errors, black screens, 404s, and rendering failures, I developed a much clearer grasp of the overall web deployment workflow, debugging strategies, and the practical skills needed to create a fully functional interactive web experience.",
    "teacherFeedback": "I am so impressed. Wrestling with digital infrastructure can be frustrating, but I’m glad you were able to work through it. It would be really interesting if you could share some of the prompts the AI returned and document what you learned in more detail.",
