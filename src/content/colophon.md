I would like to warmly acknowledge [kimi malka hanauer](https://kimihanauer.com), [Asad Pervaiz](https://oldthingsnewplaces.com/) and [Frances Pharr](https://francespharr.com/), whose
generous pedagogical practices and original curriculum design have deeply
shaped the structure and spirit of this course. This syllabus grows out of
shared teaching lineages, ongoing dialogue, and collective ways of learning
and making knowledge together.
