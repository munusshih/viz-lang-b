title: "Cyberbnetics and Playtest"
description: "We will playtest our community protocol systems in class and discuss what we've learned so far. "
longDescription: |

  What is an algorithm beyond its technical definition? How do computational and cybernetic modes of thinking influence the ways we organize, participate, and relate to one another? How can algorithmic processes be used to create more open and evolving forms of community interaction?

## Assignment

**Due:** Dec 2, 2025

<br/><br/>
Keep working on your community protocol, set it up in the desired environemnt and invite participations through playtesting.
<br/><br/>

For the final presentation, you will need to:

- Create a `fully working digital prototype` and share it through a live link, either on GitHub or a custom domain. Your prototype must run cleanly and `should not display the default p5 banner`.
- Before presenting, make sure your sketch includes some saved results from earlier experiments or interactions.
- During your presentation, you will walk us through both the previously saved results and the interactive prototype so we can see how the system behaves over time.
- You will also prepare an object label for the Open Classroom showcase that clearly introduces your project and helps viewers understand what they are seeing.

  <br/><br/>
  This is the continuing process of our [project 3: Community Protocol](https://tech-a.designfuture.space/#module-3:-cybernetics-of-live-input). We will continue to refine and develop this project over the next few weeks. The full description is [here](https://tech-a.designfuture.space/#module-3:-cybernetics-of-live-input).
