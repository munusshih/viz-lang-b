A “community” doesn’t have to be permanent. Sometimes a brief, shared situation, people gathering, coordinating, already forms a kind of community.
A gesture of kindness, if designed as a gift, service or offering, can generate a temporal community.

### Before starting it:

- Read the [THE SOCIAL CHANGE ECOSYSTEM MAP](https://buildingmovement.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ecosystem-Guide-April-2022.pdf) by Deepa Lyer from Building Movement Project.
- Look at the Characteristics of the Roles and use the guiding questions in the sheet to brainstorm what you could offer to a community and what roles you usually play, document it in your personal notebook.
- Think about what you can offer to others based on your skills, resources, time, and interests.

### The project should:

- Using the concpet of a gift, a service, gesture, or structure. Design an object with "physical takeaways" that people can take with them. Bring it to class to share with your peers.
- The design needs to enact generosity in some way, whether through sharing resources, knowledge, time, or support.
- The project should be feasible to execute within a week and should encourage participation from others.
- Document your process and reflections in your personal notebook.

The reflections you gather in your notebook will serve as source material for your collective processes and personal reflections at the end of the semester, as well as throughout the semester. We will not ask to see your notebook in full as we realize it will be highly personal, but we encourage you to really follow through with this assignment.

The original project is based on Professor [Kelsey Dusenka](https://kelseydusenka.com/), you can see their [lecture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15jmohyMnsKT3C4xqyA3p41LcYQeA2E1h/view?usp=sharing) here.
