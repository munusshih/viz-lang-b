imageMeta: "Felix Gozalez Torres's [Untitled (Portrait of Ross in L.A.) (1991)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Untitled%22_(Portrait_of_Ross_in_L.A.)) consists of a pile of candy individually wrapped in multicolored cellophane. The work invites viewers to take a piece of candy, symbolically consuming the portrait of Ross Laycock, Torres's partner who died of AIDS. As visitors take pieces of candy, the pile diminishes, but then refilled by the museum staff everyday. The work creates a participatory experience that reflects on themes of loss, memory, and the impact of AIDS on the LGBTQ+ community."
