title: "Personal Reflection Notebook"
order: 2
description: "Throughout the semester, you are expected to keep a notebook or one centralized place to house all of the reflection writing, creative processing, in-class activities, and external reading and research notes. You will use your notebook as source material for your group projects as well as your final reflection at the end of the semester."

This is a screenshot taken from Simone Forti's [Handbook in Motion](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GbvQ3lbc2ewvFoI6_0AjTq5R9CZdhFI-/view?usp=sharing), a collection of her dance scores and notes compiled between 1961 and 2008.

Your notebook should aggregate materials such as:

### During class time:

- Free writing prompts.
- Workshops and creative activities.
- Discussion notes on readings.
- Discussion notes from group critiques.
- Reflections from the DNVC Workbook (\*this work will be conducted both inside & outside of class).

### Beyond class time:

After every group collective meeting, you will take 10 minutes to reflect on your experience working in your group. Some questions to consider are included below. Please feel free to pick 1-2 questions that most resonate with you each time you reflect on your group process.

- What shifted for you today?
- What did you learn from others?
- What roles do you find yourself in, intentionally and unintentionally?
- How do you take up space in the group?
- What power dynamics are you observing in the group?
- What conditions and identities contribute to the ways you navigate group work?
- What kinds of situations and conversations make you feel comfort and discomfort?

The reflections you gather in your notebook will serve as source material for your collective processes and personal reflections at the end of the semester, as well as throughout the semester. We will not ask to see your notebook in full as we realize it will be highly personal, but we encourage you to really follow through with this assignment.

Please note: Regardless of if we see this work or not, we will be able to recognize if you are actively reflecting on your experiences within the actual work you produce and the ways you show up in the classroom.
