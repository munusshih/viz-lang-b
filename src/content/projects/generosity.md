title: "Generosity as a Tool"
order: 1
description: "Design a design artifact based on the concept of generosity as a tool for building community and fostering togetherness."
---

A community does not need to be permanent. A brief shared situation, such as people gathering, coordinating, or participating in a common gesture, can already constitute a community. When generosity is intentionally designed as a gift, service, or offering, it can give rise to a temporal community that exists through participation.

For this project, you are tasked to design an artifact or structure that enacts generosity through what you can offer others. Your offering should be grounded in your own skills, resources, time, or interests, and should invite others to participate in some way.

Think about what kind of facilitation, object, or gesture you can create that encourages others to engage with your act of generosity. This is a way for others to know you through what role you play in a community context and what you can contribute later when forming a collective.

### Before starting it:

- Read the [THE SOCIAL CHANGE ECOSYSTEM MAP](https://buildingmovement.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ecosystem-Guide-April-2022.pdf) by Deepa Lyer from Building Movement Project.
- Review the different roles outlined in the map and use the guiding questions to reflect on: What roles you often take on in collective or community contexts.
- Consider your skills, tools, access, time, and interests, and think concretely about how these could become an act of generosity. What you are able to offer others at this moment?
- Document this reflection in your personal notebook.

### The project needs to:

- Using the concept of a gift, a service, gesture, or structure that manifests as a design.
- The project must include a physical takeaway of some kind element (For example, an object, printed material, kit, or artifact). You will bring this to class to share with your peers.
- The design needs to enact generosity in some way, whether through sharing resources, knowledge, time, or support.
- The project should be feasible to execute within a week and should encourage participation from others.
- Document your process and reflections in your personal notebook.

The reflections you gather in your notebook will serve as source material for your collective processes and personal reflections at the end of the semester, as well as throughout the semester. We will not ask to see your notebook in full as we realize it will be highly personal, but we encourage you to really follow through with this assignment.
