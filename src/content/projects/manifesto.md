# 1–Collective Name

<br/>

- What is the name of your collective? Consider that while developing a name can take some negotiation, how might it reflect the practice and the process of the collective?
- As your name might be the first entry into learning about you, how might this be an opportunity for a potential audience to not only understand what your work is about, but potentially get excited and rally behind in support of your work?

<br/>

# 2–Manifesto

<br/>

- This “written statement” should be considered an outward facing material, a document that can be shared, disseminated, and help others understand the collective intent. This document is not intended to highlight individuals in the collective, rather a common goal shared by the group.
- Your written statement may include examples of systems of oppression and power for which your collective stands to “resist” or “act”. Consider the intersecting positions and contexts your collective perspective emerges through; what actions (can be pragmatic and/or speculative) are you uniquely positioned to enact in the world?
- After formally writing your manifesto, you need to put your manifesto in visual form. This visual form could be a poster, a booklet, a video, a website, anything that seems appropriate for the content of your manifesto. Allow the content of the manifesto to guide your decision as to the physical form of your manifesto.

<br/>

# 3–Ways of Working

<br/>

- What shared commitments guide your collective (e.g., mutual aid, transparency, care, anti-racism, access, experimentation, consent, refusal)?
- For each value, describe what it looks like in practice: how you make decisions, communicate, share labor, handle conflict, and support participation.
- What working agreements will help each member participate at their best (capacity, schedules, boundaries, credit, tools, accessibility needs)?

<br/>

# 4–Individual Roles

<br/>

- Before assigning specific individuals to roles, try and define the positions that support the collective endeavor first, and which roles would work in concert with each other. Try to avoid hierarchical relationships, and instead consider that each role holds demonstrative value in this space. Further, as an active collective, individual roles can be defined as active “positions” and not titles.
- Leaning into lessons on implicit and explicit roles, discuss which individuals in the collective may support specific roles. While individuals should always advocate for themselves, consider others, and how each individual can be placed in a position for success. This may take some volunteering, nomination and negotiation. Consider that some individuals may hold multiple roles, and some roles may be held by multiple individuals.
