- What are some opportunities and limitations of using code for design?
- How can you apply what you learned from this project to future design projects?
- What are some other tools or techniques you would like to explore for creating physical artifacts from code?

## Readings

Read [Designer as Engineer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oJEtrXBUt11WKcZApATYF4ZEPwDm1BgV/view?usp=sharing) from CAPSLOCK by Ruben Pater. It traces the historical role of designers using numbers, systems, forms, and standards to organize social, political, and economic life — showing how those design practices are never neutral, but deeply entangled with power, colonialism, capitalism, and governance.
