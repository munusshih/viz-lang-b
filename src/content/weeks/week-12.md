title: "Animation & Interaction"
description: "This week we're diving into animation and interaction with p5.js!"
longDescription: |

  This week we will look into all kinds of different inputs and interactions you can create with p5.js, as well as how to animate your sketches to make them more dynamic and engaging.

## Custom Libraries

Therer are many p5.js libraries that would receive live inputs from different sensors and devices.

- [p5.sound](https://p5js.org/reference/p5.sound/) - for audio input and manipulation
- [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/) - for machine learning models
- [p5.webserial.js](https://github.com/gohai/p5.webserial) - for serial communication with microcontrollers like Arduino
  <br/><br/>
  More libraries can be found on the [p5.js website](https://p5js.org/libraries/).

<br/><br/>
Begin by identifying the community you wish to engage and the environment in which your system will exist. Observe how participation naturally occurs within this context and consider how your design might introduce new forms of interaction that unfold over time.
<br/><br/>
Consider what kinds of inputs best capture participation or environmental change: sound, motion, gesture, light, text, or network data. Experiment with simple prototypes to test how these inputs might be sensed and translated into a dynamic response.
<br/><br/>

- Think about how participants will be prompted to engage. What invitations, cues, or gestures draw them in?
- What feedback encourages ongoing involvement? How might these exchanges evolve across minutes, hours, or days?
- How does the physical environment shape interactions? Consider spatial arrangements, materiality, and context.

  This is the continuing process of our [project 3: Community Protocol](https://tech-a.designfuture.space/#module-3:-cybernetics-of-live-input). We will continue to refine and develop this project over the next few weeks. The full description is [here](https://tech-a.designfuture.space/#module-3:-cybernetics-of-live-input).
