imageMeta: "[First Thing First Manifesto](https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/why-ken-garlands-first-things-first-manifesto-keeps-getting-updated/) is a call to action for designers to prioritize their work towards social and environmental causes rather than consumerism. Originally published in 1964 by Ken Garland and updated in 2000, the manifesto challenges designers to use their skills for the greater good and to consider the impact of their work on society and the planet."
